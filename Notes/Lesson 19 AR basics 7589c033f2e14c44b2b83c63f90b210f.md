# Lesson 19 | AR basics

Created: September 12, 2022 9:24 AM

We don’t have to worry about coding the 3d graphics for now. We will use the predefined assets. 

We will use **Sceneform** - an easier way to implement 3D in android.

**Textures** - .jpg that are attached to the object’s surface

**Shaders** - different predefined layers that can be attached to the object’s surface

## 3D File formats

In Android Studio, we are going to use **.gltf** extension.

In the 3D world there are loads of file formats.

Sceneform supports 3D assets in the following formats:

- OBJ
- glTF
- FBX, with or without animations.

**FBX** format stores the motion, audio and video data, but **not the textures**.

**glTF** - Called the “JPEG of 3D”. It is used for the **efficient** transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications
